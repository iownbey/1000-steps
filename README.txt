HELP:

	-It has a design like what you might expect from first-person turn-based RPGs.

	-Space lets you walk and confirms menus. Backspace exits menus. The Arrow keys let you navigate.

	-Holding down backspace will rush your player forward until the next fight.

Additions:

	-Sweet Intro (Still needs some work).

	-Enemy party system.

	-Some polish: (Monster Animations, Graphics)

	-Beginnings of a save system: (Shift+L to load; Shift+S to save)

	-Fullscreen toggle (Shift+F)

	-Probably other small things.

Known Problems:

	-Ending is incomplete. (Game stops when aragore is killed)
